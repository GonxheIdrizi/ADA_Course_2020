    "##  Some rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use any built-in Python library that comes with Anaconda. If you want to use an external library, you have to justify your choice.\n",
    "2. Make sure you use the data folder provided in the repository in **read-only** mode.\n",
    "3. Be sure to provide a textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, the solution you implemented, and explanations for your answers. A notebook that only has code cells will not suffice.\n",
    "4. For questions containing the **/Discuss:/** prefix, answer not with code, but with a textual explanation (in markdown).\n",
    "5. Back up any hypotheses and claims with data, since this is an important aspect of the course.\n",
    "6. Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code. Your repo should have a single notebook (plus the required data files) in the master branch. If there are multiple notebooks present, we will **strictly** not grade anything.\n",
    "7. Also, be sure to hand in a fully-run and evaluated notebook. We will not run your notebook for you, we will grade it as is, which means that only the results contained in your evaluated code cells will be considered, and we will not see the results in unevaluated code cells. In order to check whether everything looks as intended, you can check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed your solution there.\n",
    "8. Make sure to print results or dataframes that confirm you have properly addressed the task.\n",
    "9. Lastly, the grading is done in the *double blind* mode, i.e., the TAs grades an anonymized version of your notebook, so make sure that your notebook **neither has your team name nor the names of the members**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Publishing papers is a big part of the lives of [Ph.D. students](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=154), [post-docs](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1744) and [professors](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1051). \n",
    "In Computer Science, publishing happens mostly in conferences. What follows is a slight simplification of how these conferences decide which papers to accept and which papers to reject.\n",
    " \n",
    "Every year, scholars submit papers to prestigious conferences. The papers are then assigned to reviewers (usually around 3), who are other people from the same research community (respect thy neighbor!). Each reviewer weighs in on whether they believe the papers they were assigned are good or bad, and write a review, often along with a score (e.g. +3 Strong Accept, +2 Accept, +1 Weak Accept, 0 Borderline, …,  -3 Strong Reject). Then, in the end, \"special\" reviewers called, \"Area Chairs\" analyze all the reviews that were written for the same paper and decide what gets accepted and what gets rejected. Importantly, throughout this whole dance, reviewers and authors are anonymous. When you're reviewing a paper, you do not know who wrote it. And when you receive the review, you don't know who reviewed it. Because of that, we call this a double-blind reviewing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting development that has evolved in recent years is the rise of pre-prints. In previous times, researchers often exposed their research to the world only after it had been peer-reviewed and published in a conference or a journal. But recently researchers are much keener to let their ideas out into the world as soon as possible, and they publish their research before it has been approved to any conference or journal, by posting the research on so-called pre-print servers. The most common pre-print server for Computer Science, Physics, and Maths is called [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), for Biology, an increasingly popular one is [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), for Psychology [psyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/) (they are not very creative with the names). Notice that pre-prints and peer-review are not mutually exclusive, in fact, usually, you publish your pre-print, and then you try to publish your work in a peer-reviewed setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, publishing pre-prints has many benefits. They make science more accessible and hasten the circulation of important results in the academic community. However, a big issue brought forth with pre-prints is that they often break the anonymity in the double-blind reviewing process. For instance, in machine learning, since most papers are published as pre-prints, it is often easy to figure out if the paper you are reviewing is from a famous researcher or a big company with prominent research scientists. From critics' viewpoint, knowing the authors of the papers you are reviewing can bias your reviews. If you know that a given author is famous, you'd be more inclined to take his or her word for granted. If the author is from an institution you’ve never heard about, you are more likely to doubt his or her findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we will take a data-driven deep dive into the world of academic publishing. Can you use your freshly acquired data-science skills to predict which papers are going to make the cut? Are your data analysis skills sharp enough to figure out whether the aforementioned concerns about pre-print issues are justified?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data, whose source has been *\"double-blinded\"* from you, and which has been simplified a bit for the assignment, contains information about submissions to a prestigious machine learning conference called ICLR (pronounced “I-clear”). You can find the dataframe in the git repo for the homework (`./data/dataset_final.csv`). We provide a brief description of the fields you will encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `year`: year the paper has been submitted to ICLR. Notice that we provide data for three years, 2018, 2019, and 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `paper`: title of the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `authors`: names of the authors separated by ;.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ratings`: mean rating given to the paper by the reviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `decisions`: either Accept if the paper was accepted, or Reject otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `institution`: institutions for each of the authors, separated by ;.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `csranking`: ranking of the institutions according to csrankings. The better the institution, the better the rank. Notice that, if a paper has more than 1 author, this field will contain multiple values, separated by ;. For institutions that are not in csrankings, the value will be -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `categories`: topical categories of the paper. Each number corresponds to a different category: (1) Theory, (2) Computer Vision, (3) Natural Language Processing, (4) Adversarial ML, (5) Generative Modeling, (7) Fairness, (8) Generalization, (9) Optimization, (10) Graphs, (11) Bayesian Methods, (0) Others. A paper may belong to multiple categories, separated by ;.\n",

    "- `authors_citations`: number of citations of each one of the authors, separated by ;.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `authors_publications`: number of publications by each one of the authors, separated by ;.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `authors_hindex`: h-index of each one of the authors, separated by ;. The h-index is an author-level metric that measures both the productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar. It is the maximum value $h$ such that the given author has published $h$ papers that have each been cited at least $h$ times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `arxiv`: whether the paper was spotted in a pre-print server around the submission period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, notice that in this dataframe, when some piece of data was not available, -1 will be used as the value. For example, companies aren't a part of csrankings, so for people who work in big companies, the values are -1 in the field csranking.\n"

    "## _Step 1:_ Predicting paper ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this homework poses a simple question: Can you predict the ratings the paper will receive given attributes related to its authors? To answer this question, we will build an ML pipeline from scratch, preprocessing the data, training a regression model, and then evaluating it.\n",

    "### Task 1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the fields in the data are not very amenable to serve as input to traditional machine learning algorithms. Namely, we have some fields for which there are a varying number of values (e.g. papers with 3 authors will have 3 values in the `author_citations` field, papers with 5 authors will have 5).\n",
    "\n",

    "Your first task is to perform some feature engineering and derive unique values for each paper which you will be able to use in your ML model. \n",
    "More specifically, you must:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create 3 new fields in the dataframe corresponding to the median value of the number of citations per author, the number of publications per author, and the h-index per author. So for instance, for the row `authors_publications`, you will create an additional column, e.g. `authors_publications_median`, containing the median number of publications per author in each paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create another field entitled `reputation` capturing how famous the last author of the paper is. Notice that the last author of the paper is usually the most senior person involved in the project. This field should equal $\\log_{10}\\Big(\\frac{\\#citations}{\\#publications} + 1\\Big)$. Notice that each author in the dataset has at least 1 publication, so you don't risk dividing by 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create two fields called `has_top_company` and `has_top_institution`. The field `has_top_company` equals 1 if the article contains an author in the following list of companies `[\"Facebook\", \"Google\", \"Microsoft\", \"Deepmind\"]`, and 0 otherwise. The field `has_top_institution` equals 1 if the article contains an author in the top 10 institutions according to CSRankings.\n",
